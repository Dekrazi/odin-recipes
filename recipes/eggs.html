    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk or cream</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk or cream, salt, and freshly ground black pepper until well combined.</li>
      <li>Heat butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat until melted and foamy.</li>
      <li>Pour egg mixture into the skillet and let it sit undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set.</li>
      <li>Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges towards the center of the skillet, tilting the skillet to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking and gently stirring occasionally until the eggs are just set but still moist, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove skillet from heat immediately to prevent overcooking.</li>
      <li>Transfer scrambled eggs to a plate and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
